# My Joystick Gremlin Plugins

Plugins for [Joystick Gremlin](https://whitemagic.github.io/JoystickGremlin/).

The documentation on their website is sparse and outdated, I hope this code can
be useful for people looking into that.

## DCS World F16
See [dcs_f16_warthog.py](https://github.com/pyrho/joystick_gremlin_plugins/blob/main/plugins/dcs_f16_warthog.py).
Mainly used so that the 3-way switches (flaps, and autopilot) emit a key press when they are on the off position;
allowing for their state to be similar as in the in-game cockpit.

Some macros in there too.
